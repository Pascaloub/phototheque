# How does the plugin work
From each private album, there's a new "Share" sub menu displayed on the category (album) page.
From this menu, you can share this album.
One shared, you are provided with a unique http(s) link giving access to this album.

Behind the scene :
* A unique Piwigo user is created with a random password assigned. By default, user type is set to 'generic' 
* This user is granted to browse the selected (and only) category album. When logging with the specific link, the user is logged in and redirected

Requirements to share an album : 
- The share function can only be managed by Administrator users
- The share function is only available for private albums
